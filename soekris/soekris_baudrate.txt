New Soekris boards have RS232 baudrate of 19200 baud. To change this to 115200 baud. Do as follows.

- Remove CF card from your Soekris board.
- Connect Soekris board to your laptop via RS232 nulmodem cable and USB-to-serial adapter.
- Start Terminal emulator program(e.g. putty) and set serial baudrate at 19200 baud
- Power-on (or reset) the Soekris board (WITHOUT CompactFlash card inserted). 
- You will see the  "comBios Monitor" starting. 
- See strange characters? Then your Soekris board is not communicating at 19200 baud.
- Change baudrate using following command:
      set ConSpeed=115200
