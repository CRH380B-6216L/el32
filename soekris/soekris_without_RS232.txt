Soekris booting without RS232
=============================
Normally the Soekris only boots into the kernel when an RS232 cable is attached. You may however want it to run headless.
This can be solved by means of the following comBIOS command:

	set ConMute=enabled
  
Note: First remove CF card and poweron Soekris to enter comBIOS.
